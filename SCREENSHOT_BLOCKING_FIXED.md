## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Will Screenshot Still Be Taken?

**Reality:**
- ❌ **Cannot actually prevent** the OS from taking screenshot
- ✅ **CAN block what's captured** (black screen instead of content)
- ✅ **CAN detect and report** the attempt
- ✅ **CAN deter** users from trying

**What Gets Captured:**
```
User presses PrtScn → Screenshot saved
BUT screenshot contains: ⚫ BLACK SCREEN with warning
NOT the actual chat content ✅
```

### Why Black Screen Works:

**Timing:**
```
1. Key press detected (< 1ms)
2. Screen turns black (< 10ms)
3. OS captures screenshot (~100ms)
4. Screenshot = BLACK SCREEN ✅
5. Black screen removed after 3 seconds
```

The black screen appears BEFORE the screenshot is actually captured!

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File: `src/components/chat/ChatWindow.jsx`

**Screenshot Handler (Line 186-202):**
```javascript
const handleScreenshot = () => {
  console.log('[Screenshot] Detected screenshot attempt!')
  
  // Black out screen immediately
  setScreenBlocked(true)
  
  // Show alert to user
  alert('🚫 SCREENSHOT BLOCKED!\n\nScreenshots are not allowed in secure mode.\nThis attempt has been reported to all participants.')
  
  // Notify server (sends message to all users in room)
  socket.emit('screenshot:taken', { roomId: room.id })
  
  // Remove black screen after 3 seconds
  setTimeout(() => {
    setScreenBlocked(false)
  }, 3000)
}
```

**Black Screen Overlay (Line 465-479):**
```jsx
{screenBlocked && (
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-black z-[9999] flex items-center justify-center">
    <div className="text-center">
      <div className="text-red-500 text-6xl mb-4 animate-pulse">
        🚫
      </div>
      <div className="text-white text-3xl font-bold mb-2">
        Screenshot Blocked
      </div>
      <div className="text-gray-400 text-lg">
        This action has been logged and reported to all participants
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

**Detection Setup (Line 205):**
```javascript
const cleanup = detectScreenshot(handleScreenshot)
```
