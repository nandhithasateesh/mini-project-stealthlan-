# ✅ Google Authenticator 2FA Implementation - COMPLETE

## 🎉 All Changes Implemented Successfully!

---

## 📝 What Was Changed

### 1. ✅ Room ID Field Added to Create Room
**Location:** `src/components/chat/SecureRoomSelection.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `roomId` field to create form state
- New input field at the top of create form
- Users now enter custom Room ID (e.g., `meeting-2025`, `team-alpha`)
- Validation: Required field

**Benefits:**
- Easy to remember and share
- No more confusing UUIDs
- Users choose meaningful identifiers

### 2. ✅ Two-Step Room Creation with 2FA
**Location:** `src/components/chat/SecureRoomSelection.jsx`

**New Flow:**

**Step 1 - Basic Info:**
- Room ID
- Username
- Password
- Room Time Limit
- Burn After Reading (optional)
- Button: "Next: Setup 2FA"

**Step 2 - Google Authenticator Setup:**
- QR Code display (large, centered)
- Instructions for scanning
- 6-digit code input field
- Button: "Create Room"

**State Management:**
```javascript
view: 'selection' | 'create' | 'create-2fa' | 'join'
qrCodeData: Base64 QR code image
twoFactorSecret: Speakeasy secret
verificationCode: User-entered 6-digit code
```

### 3. ✅ Server-Side 2FA Generation
**Location:** `server/socket/chatHandler.js`

**New Socket Event:** `secure-room:generate-2fa`

**Process:**
1. Receives Room ID from client
2. Generates 2FA secret using `speakeasy`
3. Creates QR code using `qrcode` library
4. Returns: QR code as Base64 image + secret

**Code:**
```javascript
const secret = speakeasy.generateSecret({
  name: `StealthLAN:${roomId}`,
  issuer: 'StealthLAN'
});

const qrCodeDataUrl = await QRCode.toDataURL(secret.otpauth_url);
```

### 4. ✅ Updated Room Creation Handler
**Location:** `server/socket/chatHandler.js`

**Socket Event:** `secure-room:create` (updated)

**New Fields:**
- `roomId` - Custom user-provided ID
- `twoFactorSecret` - Generated secret from Step 1
- `verificationCode` - 6-digit code from Google Authenticator

**Verification:**
```javascript
const verified = speakeasy.totp.verify({
  secret: twoFactorSecret,
  encoding: 'base32',
  token: verificationCode,
  window: 2 // ±60 seconds
});
```

**Features:**
- Verifies code before creating room
- Checks if Room ID already exists
- Stores `twoFactorSecret` with room
- Returns error if verification fails

### 5. ✅ Updated Join Room Handler
**Location:** `server/socket/chatHandler.js`

**Socket Event:** `secure-room:join` (updated)

**Changes:**
- Uses room's stored `twoFactorSecret`
- Verifies current 6-digit code from Google Authenticator
- No more static PIN comparison
- Dynamic TOTP verification

**Code:**
```javascript
const verified = speakeasy.totp.verify({
  secret: room.twoFactorSecret,
  encoding: 'base32',
  token: twoFactorPin,
  window: 2
});
```

### 6. ✅ Updated Room Manager
**Location:** `server/utils/roomManager.js`

**Changes:**
```javascript
export const createRoom = (roomData, mode = 'normal') => {
  const room = {
    id: roomData.id || uuidv4(), // Use custom ID or generate
    twoFactorSecret: roomData.twoFactorSecret || null, // NEW
    // ... rest of fields
  };
};
```

**Features:**
- Supports custom room IDs
- Stores `twoFactorSecret` for verification
- Works with both normal and secure modes

### 7. ✅ Updated Join Form UI
**Location:** `src/components/chat/SecureRoomSelection.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Label changed from "Two-Factor PIN" to "Google Authenticator Code"
- Added helper text: "Enter the code from your Google Authenticator app"
- Icon changed to `Smartphone`

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dependencies Used
**Already Installed:**
- `speakeasy` - TOTP generation and verification
- `qrcode` - QR code image generation

**Import Statements Added:**
```javascript
// server/socket/chatHandler.js
import speakeasy from 'speakeasy';
import QRCode from 'qrcode';
```

### Security Implementation

**TOTP Algorithm:**
- RFC 6238 compliant
- 30-second time step
- 6-digit codes
- SHA-1 hash algorithm

**Verification Window:**
- `window: 2` = ±60 seconds
- Accounts for clock skew
- Still highly secure

**Code Characteristics:**
- Changes every 30 seconds
- Cannot be reused
- Synchronized across devices
- Time-based, not counter-based

### Data Flow

**Creating a Room:**
```

  |-- (1) Fill Room Info -------->|
  |                               |
  |-- (2) Request 2FA QR Code --->|
  |                               |
  |<-- (3) Return QR + Secret ----|
  |                               |
  [User scans QR with phone app]  |
  [Enters 6-digit code]           |
  |                               |
  |-- (4) Create with Code ------>|
  |                               |
  |         [Server verifies code]|
  |                               |
  |<-- (5) Room Created ----------|
  |                               |
  [User joins room automatically] |
```

**Joining a Room:**
```
Client                          Server
  |                               |
  [User has scanned QR earlier]   |
  [Opens Google Authenticator]    |
  [Sees current 6-digit code]     |
  |                               |
  |-- (1) Join Request + Code --->|
  |     (Room ID, Password, Code) |
  |                               |
  |   [Server retrieves room]     |
  |   [Verifies password]         |
  |   [Verifies 2FA code]         |
  |                               |
  |<-- (2) Join Success ---------|
  |                               |
  [User enters room]              |
```
