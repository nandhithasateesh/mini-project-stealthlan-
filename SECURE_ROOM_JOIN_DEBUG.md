## üîß Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ Enhanced Client-Side Error Handling

**File:** `src/components/chat/SecureRoomSelection.jsx`

**Added socket validation:**
```javascript
if (!socket) {
  setError('Socket connection not established. Please refresh the page.')
  return
}
```

**Added data trimming:**
```javascript
const joinData = {
  roomId: joinForm.roomId.trim(),  // Trim whitespace
  username: joinForm.username.trim(),  // Trim whitespace
  password: joinForm.roomPassword
}
```

**Added console logging:**
```javascript
console.log('[CLIENT] Attempting to join secure room:', joinData.roomId)
socket.emit('secure-room:join', joinData, (response) => {
  console.log('[CLIENT] Join response:', response)
  // ...
})
```

**Improved response handling:**
```javascript
if (response && response.success) {
  onRoomJoined(response.room, joinForm.username)
} else {
  setError(response?.error || 'Access denied. Please check your credentials.')
}
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Enhanced Server-Side Debugging

**File:** `server/socket/chatHandler.js`

**Added comprehensive logging:**
```javascript
console.log('[SECURE-JOIN] Received join request:', data);
console.log(`[SECURE-JOIN] User ${username} trying to join room ${roomId}`);
console.log(`[SECURE-JOIN ERROR] Room ${roomId} not found in secure rooms`);
console.log(`[SECURE-JOIN] Available secure rooms:`, Array.from(secureRooms.keys()));
console.log(`[SECURE-JOIN] Room found:`, { id: room.id, name: room.name, hasPassword: !!room.password });
console.log(`[SECURE-JOIN] Password verified for room ${roomId}`);
```

**Added callback validation:**
```javascript
if (!callback || typeof callback !== 'function') {
  console.error('[SECURE-JOIN ERROR] Callback is not a function');
  return;
}
```

**Better error messages:**
```javascript
return callback({ success: false, error: `Room "${roomId}" not found` });
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Exported secureRooms for Debugging

**File:** `server/utils/roomManager.js`

```javascript
// BEFORE:
const secureRooms = new Map();

// AFTER:
export const secureRooms = new Map();
```

This allows chatHandler to access secureRooms for debugging.

## üîç Debugging Checklist

### If Create Room Fails:

**Check Browser Console:**
- ‚ùì Does it say "Socket connection not established"?
  - **Fix:** Refresh the page
  - **Fix:** Make sure server is running

- ‚ùì Does it show an error message?
  - Read the error and follow instructions

**Check Server Terminal:**
- ‚ùì Does it show `[SECURE-CREATE]` logs?
  - If YES ‚Üí Room was created
  - If NO ‚Üí Socket event not received

- ‚ùì Does it show room in secure rooms?
  - Look for `[DEBUG] Secure rooms Map now has X rooms`

### If Join Room Fails:

**Check Browser Console:**
- ‚ùì Does it say "[CLIENT] Attempting to join"?
  - If NO ‚Üí Click event not working, check form
  - If YES ‚Üí Continue to next check

- ‚ùì What does "[CLIENT] Join response" say?
  - `{success: false, error: "Room not found"}` ‚Üí Room doesn't exist or expired
  - `{success: false, error: "Invalid password"}` ‚Üí Wrong password
  - `undefined` ‚Üí Server not responding

**Check Server Terminal:**
- ‚ùì Does it show "[SECURE-JOIN] Received join request"?
  - If NO ‚Üí Socket event not reaching server
  - If YES ‚Üí Continue to next check

- ‚ùì Does it show "Available secure rooms"?
  - Compare the Room ID you're trying to join
  - Is it in the list?

- No console logs from client

**Causes:**
