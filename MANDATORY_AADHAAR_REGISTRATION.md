# ðŸ”’ Mandatory Aadhaar Registration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

**Effective immediately, all new users MUST register using Aadhaar verification.**

Direct email/password registration has been permanently disabled to ensure enhanced security and verified identity for all users.

---

## What Changed?

### 1. Frontend Changes

#### **NormalLogin Component** (`src/components/auth/NormalLogin.jsx`)
- âœ… Removed registration form (username field, toggle between login/register)
- âœ… Changed to login-only interface
- âœ… Added prominent "Register with Aadhaar Verification" button
- âœ… Updated UI to clearly indicate Aadhaar registration is mandatory
- âœ… Removed all registration-related state and logic

**Before:**
- Users could toggle between Login and Register
- Registration form included username, email, password fields
- Direct registration was allowed

**After:**
- Login-only interface
- New users redirected to Aadhaar verification page
- Clear messaging: "ðŸ”’ Mandatory for all new users"

---

### 2. Backend Changes

#### **Aadhaar Route** (`server/routes/aadhaar.js`)
- âœ… Added user database integration
- âœ… Checks for duplicate usernames/emails
- âœ… Saves verified users to `users.json`
- âœ… Generates proper JWT tokens compatible with login system
- âœ… User data structure matches normal registration

**New User Object:**
```javascript
{
  id: uuid,
  email: username,
  username: username,
  password: hashedPassword,
  name: fullName,
  aadhaarVerified: true,
  verifiedAt: timestamp,
  twoFactorEnabled: false,
  twoFactorSecret: null,
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

#### **Auth Route** (`server/routes/auth.js`)
- âœ… Disabled `/api/auth/normal/register` endpoint
- âœ… Returns 403 error with redirect information
- âœ… Error message guides users to Aadhaar registration

**Endpoint Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Direct registration is disabled. All new users must register with Aadhaar verification.",
  "redirectTo": "/register-aadhaar"
}
```

---

### 3. Documentation Updates

#### **README.md**
- âœ… Added "Mandatory Aadhaar Verification" to features

- âœ… Updated development status
- âœ… Clear instructions for new users

## User Flow

### New User Registration (MANDATORY)

1. **Access Application**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or LAN IP)
   - Click "Normal Mode"

2. **Login Page**
   - See "New User?" notice
   - Click green "Register with Aadhaar Verification" button

3. **Aadhaar Registration Page** (`/register-aadhaar`)
   - Enter username
   - Enter full name (as on Aadhaar)
   - Create password
   - Upload Aadhaar card image (front side)

4. **Verification Process**
   - OCR extracts text from Aadhaar
   - Validates Aadhaar number using Verhoeff algorithm
   - Matches name with Aadhaar card
   - Deletes image immediately (privacy)
   - Checks for duplicate users
   - Creates account in database
   - Generates JWT token

5. **Success**
   - Automatically logged in
   - Redirected to Normal Mode chat

### Existing User Login

1. Navigate to Normal Mode
2. Enter email/username and password
3. Complete 2FA if enabled
4. Access chat interface

## Security Features

### Privacy Protection
- âœ… Aadhaar images deleted immediately after verification
- âœ… Aadhaar numbers NEVER stored in database
- âœ… Only verification status (`aadhaarVerified: true`) is saved

### Identity Verification
- âœ… Verhoeff checksum algorithm validates Aadhaar authenticity
- âœ… Name matching ensures user identity
- âœ… OCR prevents manual number entry (must use actual card)

### Account Security
- âœ… Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- âœ… JWT tokens for session management
- âœ… Optional 2FA for enhanced security
- âœ… Login attempt tracking and lockout

## Testing

### Test New User Registration

1. **Prepare Test Aadhaar**
   - Use a sample Aadhaar card image
   - Ensure image is clear and readable
   - Front side only

2. **Registration Steps**
   ```bash
   # Start servers
   cd server && npm start
   cd .. && npm run dev
   
   # Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   # Click "Normal Mode"
   # Click "Register with Aadhaar Verification"
   # Fill form and upload image
   ```

3. **Verify Success**
   - Check console logs for verification steps
   - Confirm user added to `server/data/users.json`
   - Verify Aadhaar number NOT in database
   - Confirm automatic login

### Test Existing User Login

1. Use previously registered credentials
2. Login should work normally
3. 2FA if enabled

### Test Disabled Registration

1. Try to POST to `/api/auth/normal/register`
2. Should receive 403 error
3. Error message should guide to Aadhaar registration

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Could not find valid Aadhaar number" | Image unclear or wrong format | Use clear, high-quality image |
| "Invalid Aadhaar number" | Checksum validation failed | Use genuine Aadhaar card |
| "Name mismatch" | Name doesn't match Aadhaar | Enter exact name as on card |
| "User already exists" | Username/email taken | Choose different username |
| "Image size must be less than 5MB" | File too large | Compress image |
| "Only JPEG and PNG allowed" | Wrong file format | Convert to JPEG/PNG |

---

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Installations

If you already have users registered via the old method:

1. **Existing users can still login** - No changes to login flow
2. **Old user data remains valid** - Compatible with new structure
3. **New users must use Aadhaar** - No exceptions

### Database Compatibility

Old user objects:
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "email": "...",
  "username": "...",
  "password": "...",
  "twoFactorEnabled": false,
  "createdAt": "..."
}
```

New user objects (Aadhaar):
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "email": "...",
  "username": "...",
  "password": "...",
  "name": "...",              // NEW
  "aadhaarVerified": true,    // NEW
  "verifiedAt": "...",        // NEW
  "twoFactorEnabled": false,
  "createdAt": "..."
}
```

Both formats work with the login system.
