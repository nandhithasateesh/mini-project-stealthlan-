# ✅ Room Expiration Auto-Leave Fix

## 🐛 Problem

**Issue:** Room time limit (5 minutes) expires but users remain in the room without being kicked out.

**Expected Behavior:**
- When 5-minute timer reaches 00:00:00
- Room should be deleted on server
- All users should be automatically kicked out
- Alert shown to users

**Actual Behavior:**
- Timer reaches 00:00:00 ✅
- Room deleted on server ✅
- Users NOT kicked out ❌
- No alert shown ❌

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

### Server Side (Working ✅)
The server was correctly:
1. Setting a timer when room created
2. Deleting room after time limit
3. Emitting `room:expired` event

```javascript
// Server code (already working)
setTimeout(() => {
  const roomStillExists = getRoom(room.id, 'secure');
  if (roomStillExists) {
    deleteRoom(room.id, 'secure');
    io.to(room.id).emit('room:expired', { roomId: room.id });  // ✅ Sent
    io.emit('room:removed', { roomId: room.id });
    console.log(`[SECURE] Room ${room.id} expired after ${timeLimit} minutes`);
  }
}, timeLimit * 60000);
```

### Client Side (Missing ❌)
The client was NOT:
1. Listening for `room:expired` event
2. Handling room expiration
3. Leaving the room automatically
4. Showing alert to users

**Missing:**
```javascript
// This was NOT implemented
socket.on('room:expired', ({ roomId }) => {
  // Handle expiration
})
```

---

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Added Room Expiration Handler

**File:** `src/pages/SecureMode.jsx`

```javascript
// Handle room expiration
const handleRoomExpired = useCallback(() => {
  alert('⏰ Room has expired!\n\nThe time limit has been reached and the room has been automatically deleted.')
  setCurrentRoom(null)
  setInRoom(false)
  setTimeRemaining(null)
}, [])
```

### 2. Added Socket Listener for Server Event

```javascript
// Listen for room expiration from server
useEffect(() => {
  if (!socket || !currentRoom) return

  socket.on('room:expired', ({ roomId }) => {
    if (roomId === currentRoom.id) {
      handleRoomExpired()
    }
  })

  return () => {
    socket.off('room:expired')
  }
}, [socket, currentRoom, handleRoomExpired])
```

### 3. Auto-Leave When Timer Reaches Zero

```javascript
// Room expiration timer
useEffect(() => {
  if (!currentRoom || !currentRoom.expiresAt) return

  const updateTimer = () => {
    const now = new Date().getTime()
    const expiresAt = new Date(currentRoom.expiresAt).getTime()
    const remaining = expiresAt - now

    if (remaining <= 0) {
      setTimeRemaining('00:00:00')
      // Room has expired on client side too
      handleRoomExpired()  // ✅ Auto-leave
      return
    }

    // ... update timer display
  }

  updateTimer()
  const interval = setInterval(updateTimer, 1000)

  return () => clearInterval(interval)
}, [currentRoom, handleRoomExpired])
```

### 4. Imported useCallback

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react'
```

## 📁 File Modified

**File:** `src/pages/SecureMode.jsx`

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Import `useCallback` hook
2. ✅ Added `handleRoomExpired()` function with useCallback
3. ✅ Added socket listener for `room:expired` event
4. ✅ Call `handleRoomExpired()` when timer reaches 0
5. ✅ Clean up socket listener on unmount

**Lines Modified:**
- Line 1: Added `useCallback` import
- Lines 82-87: New `handleRoomExpired` function
- Lines 98-101: Call expiration handler when timer reaches 0
- Lines 120-132: Listen for server `room:expired` event

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Server-Side Expiration
```
Server timer expires (5 minutes)
  ↓
Server deletes room
  ↓
Server emits 'room:expired' to all users
  ↓
Client receives event
  ↓
handleRoomExpired() called
  ↓
Alert shown: "Room has expired!"
  ↓
User kicked back to selection screen
```

### Scenario 2: Client-Side Timer Reaches Zero
```
Client timer counts down to 00:00:00
  ↓
remaining <= 0 detected
  ↓
handleRoomExpired() called
  ↓
Alert shown: "Room has expired!"
  ↓
User kicked back to selection screen
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple Users in Room
```
Room expires
  ↓
Server emits to ALL users in room
  ↓
EVERY user receives 'room:expired'
  ↓
ALL users see alert
  ↓
ALL users kicked out simultaneously
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Create Room with Short Time Limit

**Steps:**
1. Create room with 1-minute time limit
2. Wait for timer to reach 00:00:00
3. Observe what happens

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Timer reaches 00:00:00
✅ Alert appears: "Room has expired!"
✅ User returned to selection screen
✅ Room no longer exists
✅ Can't rejoin (room deleted)
```

### Test 2: Multiple Users

**Steps:**
1. User 1: Create room (1 minute)
2. User 2: Join same room
3. Wait for expiration

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Both users see timer counting down
✅ When reaches 00:00:00
✅ BOTH users see alert
✅ BOTH users kicked out
✅ Room deleted
```

### Test 3: Quick Test (5 minutes)

**Steps:**
1. Create room with 5-minute limit
2. Both users join
3. Send some messages
4. Wait full 5 minutes

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Timer shows: 00:04:59, 00:04:58... 00:00:01, 00:00:00
✅ Alert: "Room has expired!"
✅ All users kicked out
✅ Messages deleted (ephemeral mode)
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Broken) ❌

| Event | Server | Client |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Timer expires** | ✅ Room deleted | ❌ Still in room |
| **Event emitted** | ✅ Sent | ❌ Not listening |
| **User kicked** | N/A | ❌ No action |
| **Alert shown** | N/A | ❌ No alert |

**Result:** Users stuck in expired room forever! 🐛

### After (Fixed) ✅

| Event | Server | Client |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Timer expires** | ✅ Room deleted | ✅ Detected |
| **Event emitted** | ✅ Sent | ✅ Received |
| **User kicked** | N/A | ✅ Auto-leave |
| **Alert shown** | N/A | ✅ Alert displayed |

**Result:** Users automatically kicked out! 🎉

## 🔄 Edge Cases Handled

### Case 1: Network Delay
**Scenario:** Server expires room but client hasn't received event yet

**Handled:**
- Client timer also reaches 0
- Client-side expiration triggered
- User still kicked out ✅

### Case 2: Out of Sync Clocks
**Scenario:** Client and server clocks slightly different

**Handled:**
- Both server and client have independent timers
- Either one triggers expiration
- User kicked out regardless ✅

### Case 3: User Joins Near Expiration
**Scenario:** User joins room with 10 seconds left

**Handled:**
- Receives room with `expiresAt` timestamp
- Timer shows remaining time correctly
- Expires 10 seconds later ✅

### Case 4: Browser Tab Inactive
**Scenario:** User switches to another tab

**Handled:**
- Timer continues in background
- Socket connection maintained
- Still receives `room:expired` event ✅

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

After this fix, the following should work:

**Room Creation:**
- ✅ Timer starts from specified time limit
- ✅ Counts down every second
- ✅ Displays in HH:MM:SS format

**During Timer:**
- ✅ All users see same timer
- ✅ Timer stays synchronized
- ✅ Turns red < 10 seconds

**At Expiration:**
- ✅ Timer reaches 00:00:00
- ✅ Alert shown to all users
- ✅ All users kicked out
- ✅ Room deleted from server
- ✅ Can't rejoin (room doesn't exist)

**After Expiration:**
- ✅ Users back at selection screen
- ✅ Can create new room
- ✅ Can join other rooms
