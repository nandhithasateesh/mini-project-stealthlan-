## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Server Considerations

**Memory Usage:**
- Large files are converted to base64 (increases size by ~33%)
- 500MB file → ~665MB in memory
- Ensure server has adequate RAM

**Upload Speed:**
```
100MB file on typical connection:
- Fast WiFi: 30-60 seconds
- Regular WiFi: 1-3 minutes
- Mobile 4G: 2-5 minutes
- Slow connection: 5-10 minutes
```

**Database Impact:**
- Files stored as base64 in database
- Large files increase database size
- Regular cleanup recommended
