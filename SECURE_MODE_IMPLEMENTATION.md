# Secure Mode Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the complete implementation of the enhanced Secure Mode feature for the StealthLAN application. The secure mode now provides true end-to-end encryption, 2FA authentication, auto-deletion, and enhanced security features.

## ‚ú® Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Direct Room Access (No Session Setup)**
- When users click "Secure Mode", they see two options immediately:
  - **Create Room**
  - **Join Room**
- No authentication or session setup required
- Truly ephemeral - no data persistence

### 2. **Create Room Flow**

#### Mandatory Fields:
- **Username**: User's display name in the room
- **Room Password**: Minimum 6 characters (mandatory)
- **Two-Factor Authentication PIN**: Exactly 6 digits (mandatory)
- **Room Time Limit**: Time in minutes before auto-deletion (mandatory)

#### Optional Fields:
- **Burn After Reading**: Messages auto-delete based on time limit

#### What Happens:
1. User fills all mandatory fields
2. Room is created with a unique Room ID
3. Timer starts immediately based on the time limit
4. User is shown an alert with:
   - Room ID
   - Password
   - 2FA PIN
   - Time limit
5. These credentials must be shared with others to join
6. User automatically joins the room

### 3. **Join Room Flow**

#### Required Fields:
- **Room ID**: Unique identifier (obtained from room creator)
- **Username**: Display name
- **Room Password**: Must match room password
- **Two-Factor Authentication PIN**: Must match room's 2FA PIN

#### Verification Process:
1. System checks if Room ID exists
2. Verifies password matches
3. Verifies 2FA PIN matches
4. If ANY credential is wrong ‚Üí Access Denied
5. If all match ‚Üí User joins the secure room

### 4. **Chat Features in Secure Mode**

#### End-to-End Encryption
- All messages are encrypted using AES-256
- Encryption key generated from: Room ID + Password + 2FA PIN
- Only users with correct credentials can decrypt messages

#### File Sharing
- **Image/Video/Document Upload**: Files appear as previews in chat
- **Download Button**: Visible on each file
- **Download Notification**: When someone downloads a file, all users see:
  ```
  üì• [Username] downloaded [filename]
  ```
- **Preview**: Images show inline, videos have player, documents have preview button

#### Screenshot Protection (Secure Mode Only)
- Detects screenshot attempts (PrtScn, Win+Shift+S, Cmd+Shift+3/4/5)
- **Instant Response**:
  1. Screen turns completely black immediately
  2. Shows warning message: "üö´ Screenshot Blocked"
  3. Notifies all users in the room:
     ```
     üì∏ [Username] tried to take a screenshot
     ```
  4. Black screen remains for 2 seconds

#### Auto-Delete Features

##### Room Expiration:
- Timer starts when room is created
- After time limit expires:
  - Room is automatically deleted
  - All messages deleted
  - All uploaded files deleted
  - Users are notified and kicked out

##### Empty Room Deletion:
- When ALL users leave/go offline:
  - 10-minute countdown timer starts
  - If no one rejoins within 10 minutes:
    - Room and all data deleted permanently
  - If someone rejoins before 10 minutes:
    - Timer is cancelled
    - Room continues normally

##### Burn After Reading (Optional):
- If enabled, messages auto-delete based on room time limit
- Files are also deleted when messages expire

### 5. **System Messages**
Users see system notifications for:
- User joined the room
- User left the room
- Screenshot attempts
- File downloads
- Room expiration warnings
