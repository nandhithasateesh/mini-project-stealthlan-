# ‚úÖ Host Leave Issue - Fixed

## üêõ Problem

**Issue:** When creating a room and entering it, immediately saw the message:
```
"The host nand left the room and the room is deleted. 
You will be returned to the secure mode landing page."
```

This was happening even though the host didn't actually leave.

---

## üîç Root Cause

### Issue 1: Automatic room:leave on Component Unmount
The `ChatWindow` component was emitting `room:leave` in its cleanup function:

```javascript
// BEFORE (causing the issue):
return () => {
  socket.emit('room:leave', { roomId: room.id })  // ‚ùå This triggered host-leave
  // ... cleanup ...
}
```

**Why this caused problems:**
- React re-renders trigger cleanup functions
- Page refreshes trigger cleanup
- Component updates trigger cleanup
- Each time ‚Üí `room:leave` emitted ‚Üí Host detected as leaving ‚Üí Room deleted ‚ùå

### Issue 2: Immediate Deletion on Disconnect
When host's socket disconnected (even temporarily), the room was immediately deleted:

```javascript
// BEFORE (too aggressive):
if (socket.mode === 'secure') {
  // Delete ALL hosted rooms immediately ‚ùå
  deleteRoom(room.id, 'secure');
}
```

**Why this caused problems:**
- Page refresh = disconnect + reconnect
- Network hiccup = brief disconnect
- Tab switch (mobile) = brief disconnect
- Each time ‚Üí Room immediately deleted ‚ùå

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Removed Auto room:leave on Cleanup

**File:** `src/components/chat/ChatWindow.jsx`

```javascript
// AFTER (fixed):
return () => {
  // Don't emit room:leave on cleanup - causes issues with host-leave detection
  // The disconnect handler on server will handle cleanup properly
  // socket.emit('room:leave', { roomId: room.id })  // ‚úÖ Commented out
  
  // Just clean up listeners
  socket.off('message:new')
  socket.off('message:deleted')
  // ... etc
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ No false host-leave detections
- ‚úÖ Page refresh doesn't trigger deletion
- ‚úÖ React re-renders safe
- ‚úÖ Component updates safe

### Fix 2: Added 30-Second Grace Period for Disconnects

**File:** `server/socket/chatHandler.js`

```javascript
// AFTER (graceful):
socket.on('disconnect', async () => {
  if (socket.mode === 'secure') {
    const hostedRooms = getRooms('secure').filter(room => 
      room.createdBy === socket.username
    );

    // Set 30-second timer for each hosted room
    for (const room of hostedRooms) {
      console.log(`[HOST-DISCONNECT] Starting 30-second reconnect timer...`);
      
      const timerId = setTimeout(() => {
        // Check if host reconnected
        const socketsInRoom = io.sockets.adapter.rooms.get(room.id);
        let hostIsBack = false;
        
        if (socketsInRoom) {
          for (const socketId of socketsInRoom) {
            const s = io.sockets.sockets.get(socketId);
            if (s && s.username === room.createdBy) {
              hostIsBack = true;
              break;
            }
          }
        }
        
        if (hostIsBack) {
          // Host reconnected - don't delete!
          console.log(`[HOST-RECONNECT] Host reconnected. Cancel deletion.`);
          return;
        }
        
        // Host didn't reconnect in 30 seconds - delete room
        console.log(`[HOST-DISCONNECT-TIMEOUT] Host didn't reconnect. Deleting...`);
        deleteRoom(room.id, 'secure');
        io.to(room.id).emit('room:deleted-by-host', { ... });
      }, 30000); // 30 seconds grace period
      
      roomOfflineTimers.set(`host-disconnect-${room.id}`, timerId);
    }
  }
});
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Page refresh allowed (< 30 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Brief disconnects allowed
- ‚úÖ Network hiccups tolerated
- ‚úÖ Only deletes if truly gone

### Fix 3: Cancel Timer on Host Reconnect

**File:** `server/socket/chatHandler.js`

```javascript
// When host rejoins (secure-room:join):
// Cancel host-disconnect timer if host is reconnecting
if (roomOfflineTimers.has(`host-disconnect-${roomId}`)) {
  clearTimeout(roomOfflineTimers.get(`host-disconnect-${roomId}`));
  roomOfflineTimers.delete(`host-disconnect-${roomId}`);
  console.log(`[SECURE-JOIN] Host reconnected. Cancelled timer.`);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Immediate cancellation on reconnect
- ‚úÖ No waiting for 30-second timeout
- ‚úÖ Room preserved instantly

**Expected:**
```
‚è≥ 0-30 seconds: Room still active
‚úÖ After 30 seconds: Member sees "host left" alert
‚úÖ Room deleted
‚úÖ Member kicked to landing page
```

### Test 5: Quick Close/Reopen (< 30 seconds)
**Steps:**
1. Create room
2. Close browser
3. Reopen within 10 seconds

## üîß Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/chat/ChatWindow.jsx`
**Change:** Removed automatic `room:leave` emit on cleanup

**Before:**
```javascript
return () => {
  socket.emit('room:leave', { roomId: room.id })  // ‚ùå
  socket.off('message:new')
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
return () => {
  // Commented out to prevent false triggers
  // socket.emit('room:leave', { roomId: room.id })
  socket.off('message:new')
}
```

### 2. `server/socket/chatHandler.js`
**Changes:**
- Added 30-second grace period for host disconnects
- Added host reconnection detection
- Added timer cancellation on rejoin

**Key additions:**
