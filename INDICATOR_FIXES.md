# Typing & Recording Indicator Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Typing Indicator Bug**
**Problem**: The typing indicator would persist even after the user stopped typing.

**Root Cause**: Mismatch between the data structure used in `user:typing` (adding `username` string) and `user:stopped-typing` (filtering by `userId`).

**Solution**:
- Changed typing users to store objects with both `userId` and `username`
- Updated the filtering logic to properly match and remove users
- Fixed the display to extract usernames from the object array

### 2. **Recording Indicator Missing**
**Problem**: No visual indicator when users were recording audio or video messages.

**Solution**:
- Added new `recordingUsers` state in ChatWindow
- Created socket events: `recording:start` and `recording:stop`
- Added visual indicator showing who is recording and what type (audio/video)
- Integrated recording events in AudioRecorder and VideoRecorder components

## Changes Made

### Client-Side Changes

#### 1. **ChatWindow.jsx**
- Added `recordingUsers` state to track users currently recording
- Updated typing indicator to use object structure: `{ userId, username }`
- Added socket listeners for recording events:
  - `user:recording` - When someone starts recording
  - `user:stopped-recording` - When someone stops recording
- Added visual recording indicator with red pulsing dot
- Passed `socket` and `roomId` props to AudioRecorder and VideoRecorder

#### 2. **AudioRecorder.jsx**
- Added `socket` and `roomId` props
- Emits `recording:start` when recording begins
- Emits `recording:stop` when recording ends or is cancelled
- Notifies other users in the room about recording status

#### 3. **VideoRecorder.jsx**
- Added `socket` and `roomId` props
- Emits `recording:start` when recording begins
- Emits `recording:stop` when recording ends or is cancelled
- Notifies other users in the room about recording status

### Server-Side Changes

#### **chatHandler.js**
- Added `recording:start` event handler
  - Broadcasts `user:recording` to other users in the room
  - Includes userId, username, and recording type (audio/video)
- Added `recording:stop` event handler
  - Broadcasts `user:stopped-recording` to other users in the room

## How It Works Now

### Typing Indicator
1. User starts typing â†’ `typing:start` emitted
2. Server broadcasts `user:typing` with `{ userId, username }`
3. Other users see: "Username is typing..."
4. After 2 seconds of no typing â†’ `typing:stop` emitted
5. Server broadcasts `user:stopped-typing` with `{ userId }`
6. Indicator removed by matching userId

### Recording Indicator
1. User clicks record button â†’ `recording:start` emitted with type
2. Server broadcasts `user:recording` with `{ userId, username, type }`
3. Other users see: "Username (audio)" or "Username (video)" with red pulsing dot
4. User stops/cancels recording â†’ `recording:stop` emitted
5. Server broadcasts `user:stopped-recording` with `{ userId }`
6. Indicator removed by matching userId

## Visual Indicators

### Typing Indicator
```
Username is typing...
```
- Gray italic text
- Shows multiple users: "User1, User2 are typing..."

### Recording Indicator
```
ðŸ”´ Username (audio)
```
- Red italic text with pulsing red dot
- Shows recording type (audio/video)
- Multiple users: "User1 (audio), User2 (video)"

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Typing Indicator**:
   - Open two browser windows with different users
   - Start typing in one window
   - Verify the other window shows "Username is typing..."
   - Stop typing and wait 2 seconds
   - Verify the indicator disappears

2. **Recording Indicator**:
   - Open two browser windows with different users
   - Click the microphone or video button in one window
   - Verify the other window shows "Username (audio)" or "Username (video)"
   - Stop or cancel the recording
   - Verify the indicator disappears immediately

## Benefits

âœ… **Accurate Status**: Indicators only show when users are actually typing/recording
âœ… **Real-time Updates**: Immediate feedback when status changes
âœ… **Multiple Users**: Properly handles multiple users typing/recording simultaneously
âœ… **Clean UI**: Indicators disappear as soon as the action stops
âœ… **Type Awareness**: Shows what type of recording (audio/video)

### Socket Events

| Event | Direction | Data | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|------|---------|
| `typing:start` | Client â†’ Server | `{ roomId }` | User started typing |
| `typing:stop` | Client â†’ Server | `{ roomId }` | User stopped typing |
| `user:typing` | Server â†’ Clients | `{ userId, username }` | Notify others user is typing |
| `user:stopped-typing` | Server â†’ Clients | `{ userId }` | Notify others user stopped |
| `recording:start` | Client â†’ Server | `{ roomId, type }` | User started recording |
| `recording:stop` | Client â†’ Server | `{ roomId }` | User stopped recording |
| `user:recording` | Server â†’ Clients | `{ userId, username, type }` | Notify others user is recording |
| `user:stopped-recording` | Server â†’ Clients | `{ userId }` | Notify others user stopped |

### State Management

```javascript
// Typing users: Array of objects
typingUsers = [
  { userId: '123', username: 'Alice' },
  { userId: '456', username: 'Bob' }
]

// Recording users: Array of objects
recordingUsers = [
  { userId: '123', username: 'Alice', type: 'audio' },
  { userId: '789', username: 'Charlie', type: 'video' }
]
```
