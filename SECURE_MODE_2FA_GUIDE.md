## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Invalid verification code" During Room Creation

**Causes:**
- Code expired (30-second window)
- Phone time not synced
- Typo in code entry

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for new code to appear (up to 30 seconds)
2. Check phone Settings ‚Üí Date & Time ‚Üí Set Automatically
3. Re-scan QR code if problem persists
4. Try clicking "Back" and re-generating 2FA

### "Invalid 2FA code" When Joining

**Causes:**

1. Verify you scanned the correct room's QR code
2. Make sure entry name matches: `StealthLAN:[RoomID]`
3. Wait for fresh code and try again
4. Sync phone time: Settings ‚Üí Date & Time
5. Ask host to re-send QR code

### "Room ID already exists"

**Cause:**
- Another room with same ID already active

**Solution:**
- Choose a different, unique Room ID
- Add timestamp: `meeting-oct14-2pm`
- Add random suffix: `project-abc123`

### Can't Scan QR Code

**Solutions:**
1. Increase screen brightness
2. Move phone closer/farther from screen
3. Clean phone camera lens
4. Try screenshot method:
   - Take screenshot of QR code
   - Share via email/message
   - Scan from other device screen

### Lost Phone / Google Authenticator Access

**Prevention:**

**If Already Lost:**
- Cannot join existing rooms
- Must create new room
- Previous rooms become inaccessible

## üÜö Old vs New Comparison

| Feature | Old (Manual PIN) | New (Google Authenticator) |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| **Room ID** | Auto-generated UUID | Custom user-defined ID |
| **2FA Method** | Static 6-digit PIN | Dynamic TOTP codes |
| **Security** | Medium (PIN can be shared easily) | High (codes change every 30 seconds) |
| **Setup** | Enter PIN manually | Scan QR code with app |
| **Joining** | Enter same PIN | Enter current code from app |
| **Code Reuse** | PIN never changes | Code changes every 30 seconds |
