Shows all rooms where the user is a member with:
- Room name and description
- Host indicator
- Quick "Join" button to re-enter without password

### ✅ 2. **Room Statistics** (Everyone Sees)
Each room displays:
- **⏱️ Expiry Timer** - Real-time countdown to room expiration
- **👥 Online Now** - Number of users currently active
- **✅ Total Members** - All-time members who joined
- **⚠️ Failed Attempts** - (Host Only) Number of failed join attempts

- Grid layout for easy viewing

### ✅ 5. **Host-Only Controls** (Expandable Section)
Only visible to the room creator:

#### **Failed Join Attempts**
- Username of failed attemptee
- Reason for failure (e.g., "Invalid password")
- Timestamp of attempt
- Red color-coded display

#### **Full Attendance Log**
Complete history of all room activity:
- **Joined** - When users enter (green)
- **Left** - When users leave (gray)
- **Kicked** - When users are removed (red, shows who kicked them)
- Timestamps for all actions

---

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend

#### **New Component**: `RoomDashboard.jsx`
Located: `src/components/dashboard/RoomDashboard.jsx`

**Features:**
- Expandable/collapsible room cards
- Real-time data updates via socket.io
- Host-only controls with visibility toggle
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Countdown timer with color coding (red when < 5 minutes)

### Backend

#### **Socket Handlers** (in `chatHandler.js`)

**1. `dashboard:get-rooms`**
```javascript
socket.on('dashboard:get-rooms', async () => {
  // Returns all rooms where user is a member
  // Includes: onlineUsers, members, failedAttempts, attendanceLog
})
```

**2. `room:rejoin`**
```javascript
socket.on('room:rejoin', ({ roomId }, callback) => {
  // Allows members to rejoin without password
  // Adds to attendance log
  // Updates online users
})
```

**3. Attendance Logging**
Automatically tracks:
- `room:join` → Logs "joined" event
- `room:leave` → Logs "left" event  
- `user:kick` → Logs "kicked" event with kickedBy

**4. Failed Attempts Tracking**
- Logs when password is incorrect
- Stores username, reason, timestamp

---

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **User logs into Normal Mode**
2. **Clicks Dashboard button** (📊 icon in header)
3. **Dashboard shows all joined rooms** with:
   - Expiry countdown
   - Online user count
   - Member lists
   
4. **Click "Show Details"** to see:
   - All online members
   - All members ever joined
   
5. **If Host: Click "Host Controls"** to see:
   - Failed login attempts
   - Full attendance log (joins, leaves, kicks)

6. **Click "Join" button** → Instantly enter room without password

## Data Structure

### Room Object (Extended)
```javascript
{
  id: "room-uuid",
  name: "My Room",
  description: "Room description",
  createdBy: "host-username",
  createdAt: "2025-10-16T00:00:00.000Z",
  expiryTime: "2025-10-16T01:00:00.000Z", // Calculated
  members: ["user1", "user2", "user3"],
  onlineUsers: [
    { id: "uuid", username: "user1" },
    { id: "uuid", username: "user2" }
  ],
  
  // Host-Only Data
  failedAttempts: [
    {
      username: "attacker",
      reason: "Invalid password",
      timestamp: "2025-10-16T00:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  attendanceLog: [
    {
      username: "user1",
      action: "joined",
      timestamp: "2025-10-16T00:10:00.000Z"
    },
    {
      username: "user2",
      action: "left",
      timestamp: "2025-10-16T00:20:00.000Z"
    },
    {
      username: "user3",
      action: "kicked",
      kickedBy: "host-username",
      timestamp: "2025-10-16T00:25:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Real-Time Updates

### Auto-Refresh (Every 5 Seconds)
- Room list
- Online user counts
- Expiry timers

### Socket Updates
- `dashboard:rooms-data` → Full room data
- `dashboard:room-update` → Single room update
- `room:online-users` → Online members changed
- `user:joined` → Someone joined
- `user:left` → Someone left

---

## Security & Access Control

### ✅ Room Access
- **Members only** - Can see rooms they've joined
- **Auto-entry** - Can rejoin without password (already validated once)
- **Host privileges** - Only host sees failed attempts and full logs

### ✅ Data Privacy
- Failed attempts hidden from non-hosts
- Attendance log hidden from non-hosts
- Each user only sees their own joined rooms

---

## Testing

### Test as Regular User
1. Join Normal Mode
2. Join a room with password
3. Click Dashboard (📊)
4. See: Expiry timer, online count, members
5. Click "Show Details" → See all members
6. Click "Join" → Re-enter room without password

### Test as Host
1. Create a room in Normal Mode
2. Someone tries wrong password (failed attempt)
3. Someone joins successfully
4. Someone leaves
5. Kick someone
6. Click Dashboard → Your room
7. Click "Show Details" → Everyone sees members
8. Click "Host Controls" → See:
   - Failed attempts list

---

## Performance

- **Efficient Queries**: Only fetches rooms where user is member
- **Batch Updates**: Room data sent in single payload
- **Lazy Loading**: Host controls collapsed by default
- **Smart Refresh**: 5-second intervals, not continuous polling

---
