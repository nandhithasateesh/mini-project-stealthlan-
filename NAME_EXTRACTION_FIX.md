# 🔧 Name Extraction Fix - Bilingual Aadhaar Cards

## Problem Identified

Your Aadhaar card has **both Tamil and English text**:

```
Tamil:    சரோன் போன்சிலி (Sharon Ponsily)
English:  C Sharon Ponsily
```

**OCR was reading Tamil text as**: "hd CO meses BAe" (garbage)

**You entered**: "c sharon ponsily"

**Result**: Name mismatch error ❌

---

## Root Cause

The old name extraction logic:
1. Read all lines
2. Look for "Name:" keyword
3. Take the first line with English letters

**Problem**: Tamil text appeared before English text, so OCR misread it as "hd CO meses BAe"

---

## Solution Applied

### **New Logic** ✅

1. **Collect ALL potential English names** (ignore non-English text)
2. **Filter out common words** (Government, India, DOB, etc.)
3. **Select the LONGEST name** (full name, not just initials)

### **Code Changes**:

```javascript
// OLD: Took first English line (could be Tamil misread)
// NEW: Collects all English lines, picks longest

const potentialNames = [];
for (const line of lines) {
  // Must be English letters only
  if (/^[a-zA-Z\s]+$/.test(line)) {
    // Skip common words
    if (!skipWords.includes(line.toLowerCase())) {
      potentialNames.push(line);
    }
  }
}

// Return longest name
return potentialNames.reduce((longest, current) => 
  current.length > longest.length ? current : longest
);
```

---

## How It Works Now

### **Your Aadhaar Card**:

```
OCR Extracts:
- "hd CO meses BAe" (Tamil misread) → Ignored (not pure English)
- "C Sharon Ponsily" (English) → ✅ Collected
- "Government of India" → Filtered out (common word)
- "DOB" → Filtered out (common word)
- "FEMALE" → Filtered out (common word)

Potential Names: ["C Sharon Ponsily"]
Longest Name: "C Sharon Ponsily"
```

### **Comparison**:

```
You entered: "c sharon ponsily"
Extracted:   "C Sharon Ponsily"

Normalized:
You:      "c sharon ponsily"
Extracted: "c sharon ponsily"

Result: MATCH ✅
```
