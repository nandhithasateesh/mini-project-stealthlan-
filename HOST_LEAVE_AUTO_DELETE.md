## 🎨 How It Works

### Scenario 1: Host Clicks "Leave Room"
```
1. Host clicks "Leave Room" button
   ↓
2. Server detects host is leaving
   ↓
3. Server emits 'room:deleted-by-host' to ALL members
   ↓
4. All members see alert:
   "🚪 Room Deleted!
    The host 'nandhitha' has left and the room has been deleted.
    You will be returned to the secure mode landing page."
   ↓
5. All members automatically redirected to landing page
   ↓
6. Room deleted from server
```

### Scenario 2: Host Closes Browser/Tab
```
1. Host closes browser tab or loses connection
   ↓
2. Server detects host disconnected
   ↓
3. Server finds all rooms created by this host
   ↓
4. Server emits 'room:deleted-by-host' to ALL members in those rooms
   ↓
5. All members see alert and redirected
   ↓
6. Rooms deleted from server
```

### Scenario 3: Regular Member Leaves
```
1. Regular member clicks "Leave Room"
   ↓
2. Server detects this is NOT the host
   ↓
3. Member removed from room
   ↓
4. Other members notified: "User left"
   ↓
5. Room continues to exist ✅
   ↓
6. Host and other members stay in room
```

## 📁 Files Modified

### 1. Server-Side: `server/socket/chatHandler.js`

#### A. Room Leave Handler (Line 365-447)

**Added Host Detection:**
```javascript
// Check if the leaving user is the host/creator
const isHost = room.createdBy === socket.username || room.createdBy === socket.userId;

if (isHost) {
  // Host is leaving - delete room and kick everyone out
  console.log(`[HOST-LEAVE] Host ${socket.username} leaving room ${roomId}. Deleting room...`);
  
  // Notify all members in the room BEFORE they leave
  io.to(roomId).emit('room:deleted-by-host', {
    roomId: roomId,
    hostName: socket.username,
    message: 'Room has been deleted because the host left'
  });

  // Cancel any existing timers
  if (roomOfflineTimers.has(roomId)) {
    clearTimeout(roomOfflineTimers.get(roomId));
    roomOfflineTimers.delete(roomId);
  }

  // Delete the room
  deleteRoom(roomId, socket.mode);
  io.emit('room:removed', { roomId });

  console.log(`[HOST-LEAVE] Room ${roomId} deleted by host ${socket.username}`);
  
  if (callback && typeof callback === 'function') {
    callback({ success: true, hostLeft: true });
  }
  return;
}

// Normal member leaving (not host) - continue with existing logic
// ... rest of the code ...
```

#### B. Disconnect Handler (Line 740-825)

**Added Host Disconnect Detection:**
```javascript
// Check if disconnecting user is a host of any secure rooms
if (socket.mode === 'secure') {
  const secureRoomsList = getRooms('secure');
  const hostedRooms = secureRoomsList.filter(room => 
    room.createdBy === socket.username || room.createdBy === socket.userId
  );

  // Delete all rooms where this user is the host
  for (const room of hostedRooms) {
    console.log(`[HOST-DISCONNECT] Host ${socket.username} disconnected. Deleting room ${room.id}...`);
    
    // Notify all members in the room
    io.to(room.id).emit('room:deleted-by-host', {
      roomId: room.id,
      hostName: socket.username,
      message: 'Room has been deleted because the host disconnected'
    });

    // Cancel any timers
    if (roomOfflineTimers.has(room.id)) {
      clearTimeout(roomOfflineTimers.get(room.id));
      roomOfflineTimers.delete(room.id);
    }

    // Delete the room
    deleteRoom(room.id, 'secure');
    io.emit('room:removed', { roomId: room.id });
    
    console.log(`[HOST-DISCONNECT] Room ${room.id} deleted due to host disconnect`);
  }
}
```

### 2. Client-Side: `src/pages/SecureMode.jsx`

#### Added Event Listener (Line 155-162)

**Listen for Room Deletion by Host:**
```javascript
socket.on('room:deleted-by-host', ({ roomId, hostName, message }) => {
  if (roomId === currentRoom.id) {
    alert(`🚪 Room Deleted!\n\nThe host "${hostName}" has left and the room has been deleted.\n\nYou will be returned to the secure mode landing page.`)
    setCurrentRoom(null)
    setInRoom(false)
    setTimeRemaining(null)
  }
})
```

**Clean Up:**
```javascript
return () => {
  socket.off('room:expired')
  socket.off('room:time-extended')
  socket.off('room:deleted-by-host')  // ✅ Clean up listener
}
```

## 🚀 Edge Cases Handled

Person A leaves → Room "exam" deleted
Person B creates "exam" → New room "exam" created
✅ No conflicts
```

### Edge Case 3: Host Disconnects Mid-Message
```
Host typing message...
Host loses connection
Room deleted immediately
Members see alert mid-chat
✅ Clean handling
```

### Edge Case 4: Very Fast Disconnect/Reconnect
```
Host briefly disconnects (< 1 second)
Room deleted immediately
Host reconnects
Room still deleted (no restoration)
✅ Consistent behavior
```
